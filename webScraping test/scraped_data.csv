What type of hearing loss is it (permanent or conductive)? How severe is the hearing loss? Is the hearing loss similar across all frequencies? Is there a hearing loss in both ears? Is the hearing loss the same in both ears? Is the hearing loss stable over time (has the audiogram changed)? When did the hearing loss occur?Any hearing loss that is present at birth or soon after is referred to as congenital. Hearing loss which occurs later in life is referred to as acquired.The earlier a hearing loss occurs, the more significant its impact will be. Children who are born with a hearing loss have limited access to the sounds around them (including speech) from the very beginning.Hearing loss that occurs before a child develops speech and language skills is referred to as prelingual. Hearing loss that occurs after a child develops speech and language skills is known as postlingual.The effects of a prelingual hearing loss are usually much more significant than a postlingual hearing loss. The challenge faced by a young child with a prelingual hearing loss is to develop normal spoken language skills. The challenge faced by a child with a postlingual hearing loss is to learn to manage their hearing loss in order to minimise its impact on their daily life.What type of hearing loss is it?When a hearing loss occurs because the sound cannot travel freely down the outer ear and through the middle ear, it is referred to as a conductive hearing loss. A child with a middle ear infection may have a conductive hearing loss. If the conductive hearing loss is a result of illness or infection, then it is not permanent.Hearing loss which is caused by the sound not being converted into electrical signals within the inner ear, or not being transmitted along the auditory nerve to the brain is referred to as sensorineural hearing loss. This hearing loss is permanent.Some children experience both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss, and this is referred to as a mixed hearing loss.How severe is the hearing loss?When hearing loss is measured, it will be described as mild, moderate, severe, profound or a combination of these. For example, if someone has a moderate hearing loss in the low frequencies and a profound hearing loss in the high frequencies, this hearing loss would be described as moderate to profound.Is the hearing loss similar across all frequencies?When a hearing loss is plotted on an audiogram, it may appear flat, i.e. the hearing loss is much the same across the frequencies (seen on the diagram below), or it may be sloping, e.g. the hearing loss is much more severe in the higher frequencies than it is in the lower frequencies.Flat hearing losses are usually much easier to fit with a hearing aid. Sloping hearing losses may mean that children will miss a lot of the high frequency sounds such as ‘s’ and ‘sh’ and they are often more difficult to fit with a hearing aid.Is there a hearing loss in both ears?When there is a hearing loss in both ears, this is referred to as bilateral hearing loss. If hearing is normal in one ear, but there is a hearing loss in the other ear, this is referred to as unilateral hearing loss.Children with a unilateral hearing loss may have difficulty hearing well in noisy conditions and may have difficulty locating where sound is coming from. Teachers should make sure that children with a unilateral hearing loss always sit with their ‘good ear’ closer to the speaker.Is the hearing loss the same in both ears?When the hearing loss is very similar in both ears, this is referred to as a symmetrical loss. If the hearing loss is different in each ear, this is referred to as an asymmetrical loss. If the loss is very different in each ear, the child may experience difficulties similar to those associated with unilateral loss. Sometimes only the ‘better ear’ will be fitted with a hearing aid.Is the hearing loss stable over time?Hearing loss does not always remain the same over time. Some hearing losses, particularly conductive, may go up and down frequently. This is referred to as a fluctuating hearing loss.Children with fluctuating conductive hearing loss may develop very poor listening skills. Some hearing losses may get worse over time. This is referred to as a deteriorating hearing loss. Children with a deteriorating hearing loss may show a decline in their speech and listening skills over time.back to topFor more information:Describing the severity of the hearing lossUnilateral hearing loss"

They may also have difficulty hearing normal conversation in situations where there is a lot of background noise.To experience a mild hearing loss, try wearing earplugs or blocking your ears with your fingers. You can still hear people talking but it sounds muffled. It is even more difficult to understand the conversation if there is any background noise.Many children with mild hearing loss do not wear hearing aids. As the loss gets closer to 40dB some children may be fitted with a hearing aid.How will this impact on learning? A child with a mild hearing loss will not usually have difficulties related to their hearing loss in school unless they are in very noisy environments.For more informationBabies with a possible mild hearing lossYour baby has a mild hearing loss – What’s the next step?Your child has a mild hearing loss – What’s the next step?Management of a child with a permanent unaided hearing lossModerate Hearing Loss (41-70dB)A child with a moderate hearing loss will need to wear hearing aids to understand normal speech. Without hearing aids, the child will need to rely on speech reading cues. The level of concentration required to speechread is very difficult to maintain over long periods of time.Hearing aids make all sounds louder for the child, including background noise. Hearing aids work most effectively in quiet environments.How will this impact on learning?A child with a moderate hearing loss may:not hear important elements of a class discussion including key context and content without visual cueshave a smaller or more limited vocabulary than their same age peersnot hear all the sounds in a word, commonly leaving off ‘s’, ‘ing’ and ‘ed’ in their speech and their writinghave problems pronouncing some speech soundsbecome very tired towards the end of sessions that have required intense concentration or were conducted in noisy environmentsmisinterpret what is said although they ‘hear’ the speaker (they know that someone said something but couldn’t hear clearly enough to understand what was said).Severe hearing loss (71 – 90dB)A child with a severe loss will have difficulty understanding normal speech even when wearing their hearing aids. They would not detect normal conversation without their hearing aid but may hear loud voices at close distances (up to one metre).It is important to remember that hearing aids make sounds louder for the child which assists with comprehension but they do not restore normal hearing. Even with hearing aids, a child with a severe hearing loss will need to rely on speechreading cues. The level of concentration required to speechread is very difficult to maintain over long periods of time.Children with a severe hearing loss may be fitted with a cochlear implant. They will be able to access all speech sounds through the implant, but will have difficulty understanding speech if they are not wearing it.How will this impact on learning?A child with a severe hearing loss may:not hear important elements of the class discussion including key context and content without visual cueshave a smaller or more limited vocabulary than their same age peersnot hear all the sounds in a word, commonly leaving off ‘s’, ‘ing’ and ‘ed’ in their speech and their writinghave problems pronouncing some speech sounds, particularly those in the high frequency such as ‘s’ or ‘p’become very tired towards the end of sessions that have required intense concentration or were conducted in noisy environmentsmisinterpret what is said although they ‘hear’ the speaker’s voice (they know that someone said something but couldn’t hear clearly enough to understand what was said)have a limited understanding of colloquial language, such as ‘pull up your socks’have difficulty understanding complex sentenceshave poor vocal qualityhave trouble explaining their ideas to other peoplehave limited background knowledge and experiences in a range of areas which can affect learning and social skills.Profound Hearing Loss (91dB+)A child with a profound hearing loss will always have trouble understanding conversational speech even with their hearing aids, and would not detect even the loudest components of shouting unaided (without their hearing aid).Many students with profound hearing loss find traditional hearing aids of limited benefit. The majority of children with a profound hearing loss have cochlear implants.Children with a profound hearing loss exhibit a wide range of communication skills. Some children develop listening and spoken language as their main means of communication. Other students may need, or prefer, to rely on manual communication skills such as signing.How will this impact on learning?A child with a profound hearing loss may:not hear important elements of the class discussion including key context and content without visual cueshave a smaller or more limited vocabulary than their same age peersnot hear all the sounds in a word, commonly leaving off ‘s’, ‘ing’ and ‘ed’ in their speech and their writinghave problems pronouncing some speech sounds, particularly those in the high frequency such as ‘s’ or ‘p’become very tired towards the end of sessions that have required intense concentration or were conducted in noisy environmentsmisinterpret what is saidhave difficulty with some reading materialshave a limited understanding of colloquial language, such as ‘pull up your socks’have difficulty understanding complex sentencesuse a limited range of sentence structures and therefore use the same sentence structure repetitively (e.g. subject, verb, object)have trouble explaining their ideas to other peoplehave limited background knowledge and experiences in a range of areas which can affect learning and social skillshave poor vocal qualityrely on signed communication.back to top"
https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/resources/your-childs-hearing/hearing-aids/what-do-hearing-aids-do/,What do hearing aids do? | Aussie Deaf Kids,"It is a common belief that people with hearing loss just can’t hear sounds loudly enough, but the problem is much more complicated than that.Four main problems caused by hearing lossHow do hearing aids work and compensate for the effects of a hearing loss?Four main problems caused by hearing lossPeople with a hearing loss don’t hear soft sounds. Consequently, the softer speech sounds, which are usually the consonants, may simply not be heard. For example, the sequence of vowel sounds “i-e-a-ar” may have belonged to “pick the black harp” but could be heard by a hearing-impaired person as “kick the cat hard”. To overcome this difficulty, a hearing aid has to provide amplification to make these soft sounds loud enough to be heard.Key parts of particular speech sounds, such as the high frequency parts, might not be audible. To overcome this problem a hearing aid has to provide more amplification for frequencies where hearing loss is the greatest and where speech has the weakest sounds.A hearing-impaired ear has difficulty separating sounds. When we are listening to a sound in noise, such as a person speaking at a party, the normal ear will send a message to the brain that two separate bundles of sound are coming through. The brain, by using other information available, such as context and direction of the sound, may then be able to ignore the unwanted noise and make good use of the speech. The impaired ear however is much less efficient at this task. Also, once speech and noise get mixed together inside a hearing aid, there is no way the hearing aid can separate the two to compensate. Directional microphones can help prevent the sound and noise from getting mixed together before they are passed to the amplifier.In a normal ear, a wide range of environmental sounds can fit between the softest sound that can be heard and the loudest sound that can be comfortably tolerated. In a hearing-impaired ear this ‘dynamic’ range is greatly reduced; ie. soft sound becomes inaudible and loud sound becomes uncomfortable and sometimes painfully loud. If a hearing aid makes all sounds louder so that the hearing-impaired person can hear the softest sounds then most of the loud sounds may be far too loud. So a hearing aid must give more amplification to a soft sound than it does to a louder sound. This squashing of sounds into the reduced range of an impaired ear is called “compression”.So a hearing aid has a big task. It must:Make sounds louder but not make loud sounds uncomfortably loudProvide more amplification for frequencies where hearing loss is the greatest and speech sounds are the weakestTry to keep unwanted sounds, such a background noise, out of the signal provided to the wearerback to topHow do hearing aids work and compensate for the effects of a hearing loss?Hearing aids amplify sounds so they are loud enough to be heard. A hearing aid also amplifies some frequencies more than others to allow for the characteristics of hearing loss and speech. The audiologist will set the hearing aid to make sure its output never exceeds a predetermined upper limit, so that sounds do not become uncomfortably loud.Peak Clipping Versus CompressionThe hearing aid limits loud sounds by either clipping off the peaks of the sounds (peak clipping) or by squashing or compressing them into a softer signal (compression).Both result in some distortion and loss of detail, but the distortion is less noticeable for compression than for peak clipping. In general, compression provides a clearer signal for speech in quiet, better listening situations, comfort for loud sounds, and less need for volume control adjustment.Research has shown that most people with hearing loss, except some of those with profound hearing losses, prefer compression output limiting. This is why Hearing Australia has had compression as a feature in its hearing aids since 1986.There are many new types of hearing aids now becoming available that use complex forms of compression, all with the aim of maximizing clarity and filling the impaired dynamic range with audible and comfortable sound. Hearing Australia’s standard hearing aids have many independently adjusted compressors which interact to provide controlled and comfortable loudness. This means that compression can be set to suit the individual needs of each child.back to topRelated articles:How do audiologists select hearing aids?Looking after hearing aids"

https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/resources/education/information-for-your-childs-teacher/classroom-tips/,Classroom tips | Aussie Deaf Kids,"When addressing the pupil say his/her name first and identify the topic you are covering.Seat the pupil for optimal listening and visual cues within the classroom. Ideally, this should be with the pupil’s back to the window, seated one third of the distance of the room from the teacher, not in the front row directly beneath the teacher.Beware of possible misunderstanding – avoid idioms, sarcasm, slang (if you use them, explain).Sometimes ask other pupils if they have heard or understood rather than always focusing on the child with hearing loss.Speak in an ordinary tone of voice, without exaggerated lip movements, and at a normal rate of speaking.Make sure your lips are clearly visible. Face the class, not the blackboard, when speaking.Make sure the room does not have bright lights shining directly in the child’s face. Back-lighting is ideal.Be aware that the pupil is unlikely to be able to lip read or fully hear during a film/slide presentation. Either use a captioned film or provide information (transcript) in advance.Institute a buddy system – such as a classroom helper or official note-taker.Provide an opportunity for the pupil to share information with the class about the hearing aid and/or FM system and how it works.Request in-service instruction to learn how to check your puil’s hearing aids; keep extra batteries on hand.Be aware that every child is an individual with his/her own strengths and limitations. Thus it is important not to have a preconceived notion of function based on the degree of hearing loss.Remember always to speak naturally and clearly. If using exaggerated mouth movements, extremely fast or slow rates of speaking or overly loud speech, the pupil may have difficulty understanding.Make sure always to make lip reading possible. Thus be careful not to chew gum or eat while talking to the pupils.Remember always to make a recognisable transition when moving on to a new subject.Consider passing around a written copy of the day’s and week’s assignments for all pupils, or writing assignments on the board.back to top"
https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/resources/education/information-for-your-childs-teacher/how-listener-friendly-is-your-classroom/,How listener friendly is your classroom? | Aussie Deaf Kids,"A good listening environment is crucial to successful classroom learning. Many factors affect the listening environment. Classrooms are typically noisy and reverberant, making listening difficult for pupils with normal hearing as well as those with hearing loss.Check your classroom, using the following questions. If you discover that you have a poor listening environment (when no is answered to the following questions), follow the provided tips.Classroom checklist and useful tips1.Noise outside the classroom Yes No Is your classroom in a quiet area away from external noise sources (traffic, construction, playground, busy hallways, shops, etc.)? Tip: Reduce external noise as much as possible by evaluating your classroom location. For a pupil with a hearing loss, choose a classroom located away from traffic and noisy areas. Avoid areas where groups of children congregate. Even simple things like shrubbery just outside the classroom windows can help reduce external noise.  2.Noise inside the classroomYesNo Do you have a quiet classroom without noise sources, such as fans, heating and cooling systems, etc.? Is the floor carpeted? Do the windows have curtains? Do chairs, desks and tables have rubber stops to cut down on noise? Tip: Evaluate and monitor internal classroom noises on an ongoing basis. Air conditioners, heating systems, computers, projectors and light fixtures can all contribute to internal background noise, making hearing difficult. Most of us simply “tune out” these sounds unconsciously. But for a child with hearing instruments it is not always that easy. Have equipment serviced regularly to eliminate noise created by malfunction. And look for areas where adjustments can be made to improve classroom acoustics:Acoustically-treated low ceilingsCarpeting (floors, and even parts of walls)Well-fitting doorsThick curtains; acoustic panellingUse of absorptive materials on hard reflective surfaces (cork bulletin boards etc.)Windows and doors closed during instruction.  3.Listening skillsYesNo Do you evaluate listening skills and provide programs to strengthen these skills? Do you make listening fun? Tip: Listening skills can be evaluated in many ways and they can fun. Contact the appropriate staff person in your school regarding the availability of pupil observation forms. Use game-like activities that make your pupils want to listen.  4.Teacher’s voiceYesNo Are you projecting your voice so that you can be heard in the back of the room? Tip: Check with pupils periodically to be certain that they can hear you well. Speak clearly, but do not yell. Even though a child may be wearing hearing aids, normal hearing cannot be achieved. Seating hard-of-hearing pupils near the front of the class should be strongly considered, unless FM assistive listening equipment1 is being used.  5.Teacher’s languageYesNo When you speak, do you use clear, concise language? Tip: Use age appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure. If new words are introduced, explain them. Avoid excessive use of irony, figurative language and idioms. A child with a hearing loss is often concentrating on the literal translation. If the message is too complicated, pupils won’t listen or learn.  6.CommunicationYesNo Do you ensure that the pupils understand directions, both oral and written? Do you use visual aids (video, overheads, etc.)? Tip: Question pupils regularly regarding their understanding of written and oral directions. Do not assume that these are understood. Ask the pupil to repeat your instructions, rather than simply asking him/her if he/she heard you. Take care not to focus or single out the pupil with the hearing loss too much.  7.Hearing tacticsYesNo Is there sufficient light in the room to aid oral communication with lip reading? Do you try to talk face-to-face with your pupils? Tip: A pupil with any type of hearing loss should face away from windows to avoid light shining in his/her face. The face of the speaker should be in good light. Speaking face-to-face enables the listener to utilise visual cues such as lip reading and facial expressions. Speak in a normal tone of voice, without exaggerated lip movements. You should also model good listening habits by really listening to what your pupils are saying and showing interest. Schedule specific times for sharing information and give your full attention.  back to top Footnote:FM assistive listening equipment is now commonly called Remote Microphone Systems Additional readingListening fatigue at school"
https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/resources/language-and-communication/getting-started/a-quick-guide-to-communication/,A quick guide to communication | Aussie Deaf Kids,"As your child grows, it will be important to use good communication with them, and with the deaf adults you meet. The following tips for good communication can be used with deaf children, young people and adults who use either speech or sign language (such as Auslan) and with those children who use a combination of both speech and signing.Make sure that you have your child’s attention before starting a conversation. Make sure you are facing your child and maintaining good eye contact. Try to be on the same level as them and allow some space for signing or lip-reading. (So, keep a distance of about one to two metres between you and your child). Use a well-lit room and don’t have your back to a window, as this creates a shadow and makes it difficult to read facial expressions or lip-read. Speak clearly, naturally and at a normal pace. Don’t shout, as it can appear to your child that you are angry and it also distorts lip patterns.  Try to make sure that background noise is kept to a minimum. Children with hearing aids, cochlear implants or those children with mild or unilateral deafness who do not use hearing aids may find it particularly difficult to pick out what is being said. A room that is carpeted or curtained will help to cut down the effects of noise in a room. If your child does not use sign language, it is still helpful to use your hands and facial expressions to gesture and support what you are saying. Don’t eat, smoke, or block the view of your face while you are speaking. If you have a beard or moustache, keep it trimmed. Also remember that glasses and sunglasses can make it difficult to maintain eye contact. When in a group, speak one at a time. It is helpful if the speaker raises their hand before talking so that your child knows who is speaking. Make sure you let your child know when there is a new topic of conversation. If a word or sign is not easily understood, use a more common word or sign with the same meaning. Be wary of using unusual words. Pause between sentences and check that your child has understood you, and that you have understood them.  Encourage them to stop you if they don’t understand what the conversation is about."
